### Newborn Lifestyle Session
**$300 1-3hrs 25+ Images**

The session is a little different from a traditional photo shoot. I will come
to your house and take stunning photos of you and your little newborn just
living and loving life. These photo's are typically taken in the first two
weeks of life. I also make hospital visits too, just ask!

### Boudoir
**$300 1-2hrs 20+ Images**

Boudoir sessions are very fun! About every 2-3 months I host a boudoir marathon
where I rent out a luxurious home and do photo sessions back to back. I have a
makeup artist on site with an added fee. I also supply drinks and light snacks.
Please email for more questions about this type of event. House calls are also
an option if the event isn't soon enough for you.
