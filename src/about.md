## Hi!

I'm Ciarra Godson and I would love to take your photo! From a young age I just
knew I would be a photographer. I picked up my very first camera when I was 13.
I spent most days following my friends around and (annoyingly) taking their
photos. In high school I spent my days tracking down adventures and capturing
it all the while practically living in my schools photo room. Fast forward to
now, I live in Portland, OR and love every minute of it. I am a mother of two
wonderful boys who have taught me the true meaning of love and beauty. I spend
the bulk of my time capturing moments and caring for my boys. 

I can't wait to capture your world!
